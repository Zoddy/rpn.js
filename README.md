# rpn.js
simple reverse polish notation lib.

## usage
let's see some examples:

```
var rpn = new (require('./app.js'))();
```

```
// all of them has 11 as a result
var foo = 1 + 4 + 2 * 3 // normal notation
var foo = rpn.multiply(2, 3).plus(1, 4).plus().toNumber(); // rpn object-oriented
var foo = rpn.calc('2 3 * 1 4 + +'); // rpn formula
```

```
// all of them has 21 as result
var foo = (1 + 2) * (3 + 4); // normal notation
var foo = rpn.plus(1, 2).plus(3, 4).multiply().toNumber(); // rpn object-oriented
var foo = rpn.calc('1 2 + 3 4 + *'); // rpn formula
```

If you use the object-oriented calculation style, you have manually call `.toNumber()` to get the result. With the `calc`-function (formula-style) you will get the result directly.

## reset
to empty the stack just call `rpn.reset()` to do so. `.toNumber()` and `.calc()` will automatically reset the stack.

## operations
- plus (+)
- minus (-)
- multiply (*)
- divide (/)
